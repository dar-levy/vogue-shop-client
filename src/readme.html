<h1>Vogue Clothes - Readme</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project was developed individually and collaboratively with Ziv Somech. The project involves creating an online store named "Vogue Clothes" where customers can browse and purchase fashionable clothing items.</p>

<h2>Store Name</h2>
<p>The store is called <strong>Vogue Clothes</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Are We Selling?</h2>
<p>We are selling fashionable clothing items under the brand name "Vogue Shop".</p>

<h2>Additional Pages Added</h2>
<p>We added several additional pages to enhance the user experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>About</strong> - Displays a description of the shop, which is fetched from the backend server.</li>
    <li><strong>Contact</strong> - Provides information on how to contact us, the website developers. This data is also fetched from the backend server.</li>
    <li><strong>New Arrivals</strong> - Shows the shop's upcoming new arrivals. The data is retrieved from the backend server in JSON format.</li>
    <li><strong>Reviews</strong> - Displays reviews about the website written by users. The data is fetched from the backend server in JSON format.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pages can be accessed by clicking on the corresponding links in the navbar header. They operate just like any other page, displaying their contents when selected.</p>

<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>One of the hardest parts of this project was <strong>storing data globally using React Store Context</strong>. Ensuring data was available across different components and routes was a challenging but rewarding task.</p>
<p>Another challenge we faced was coordinating our work schedules. I was on heavy military reserve duty, which limited my ability to work on the project to when I was home. Meanwhile, Ziv had just started a new job, which also demanded much of his time. To overcome this, we began using Git to synchronize our work, which greatly improved our communication and allowed us to track what needed to be done and what had already been completed.

<h2>Supported Routes</h2>
<p>The application supports the following routes:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>/catalog</code> - Displays the catalog of available products.</li>
    <li><code>/catalog/:id</code> - Displays detailed information about a specific product.</li>
    <li><code>/about</code> - Displays information about the store.</li>
    <li><code>/contact</code> - Provides contact details and a form for inquiries.</li>
    <li><code>/reviews</code> - Displays customer reviews.</li>
    <li><code>/new-arrivals</code> - Shows the latest products added to the store.</li>
    <li><code>/new-product</code> (Admin Only) - Allows adding a new product to the catalog.</li>
    <li><code>/activity-history</code> (Admin Only) - Displays the activity history.</li>
    <li><code>/basket</code> - Shows the current items in the shopping basket.</li>
    <li><code>/checkout</code> - Handles the checkout process.</li>
    <li><code>/thank-you/:id</code> - Displays a thank you message after a successful purchase.</li>
    <li><code>/logout</code> - Logs the user out of the application.</li>
    <li><code>/not-found</code> - Displays a 404 error page when a route is not found.</li>
    <li><code>/register</code> - Allows new users to create an account.</li>
    <li><code>/login</code> - Allows existing users to log in.</li>
    <li><code>/</code> - Redirects to the <code>/catalog</code> route if logged in, or <code>/login</code> if not.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>We implemented the following extra features in our work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>We integrated the admin panel into the catalog feed, allowing the admin to directly manage products from the <code>/catalog</code> route when logged in.</li>
    <li>For added security, we did not store users' plaintext passwords. Instead, we stored hashed versions of the passwords.</li>
    <li>To further enhance security, we used a salt to generate hash values. This ensures that two identical passwords do not produce the same hash. We stored the salt used for each user and utilized it to generate the hashed password when validating user identity.</li>
    <li>To protect against DDoS attacks, we implemented a rate-limiting feature, allowing a certain number of requests from an IP address within a specific time window. In our case, we set a limit of 100 requests every 3 minutes.</li>
</ul>
